Problem Statement – Music Store Database Data Analysis

The music store generates large volumes of transactional and customer data, but lacks actionable insights to support strategic business decisions such as customer targeting, artist promotion, event planning, and market expansion. Raw data spread across multiple relational tables (customers, invoices, tracks, artists, genres, and employees) makes it difficult to answer key business questions without structured analysis.

The objective of this project is to analyze the Music Store Database using SQL to uncover meaningful insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, popular genres, top artists, and geographic trends. By writing optimized SQL queries involving joins, subqueries, aggregations, window functions, and CTEs, the project aims to:

Identify top-performing employees, customers, cities, and countries

Analyze revenue distribution across invoices and locations

Understand customer listening preferences by genre and artist

Determine best-selling artists and most popular genres by country

Evaluate customer spending patterns at both global and regional levels

These insights help the business make data-driven decisions for marketing campaigns, promotional events (such as music festivals), artist invitations, and customer retention strategies.
